When reading a csv file, use os.path.join(sys.path[0], input()).
Create the required file and write the test files in a seperate test folder.
If dataset is not available create one.

# Instructions for IPYNB
    # If i ask u to create plots, use a ipynb and place the plot generation code for each graph in seperate cells.
    # When referencing a dataset that is available locally, u need to push the dataset to github and use the raw github link for the dataset from github for reading with pandas.
    # Run the IPYNB with the google colab extension i installed for vs code.
    # Make sure all the util methods and everything within a single ipynb file and no additions file is created for generating the required graphs.

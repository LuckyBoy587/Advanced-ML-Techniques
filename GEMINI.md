# Instructions for IPYNB
    # If i ask u to create plots, use a ipynb and place the plot generation code for each graph in seperate cells.
    # When referencing a dataset that is available locally, u need to push the dataset to github and use the raw github link for the dataset from github for reading with pandas.
    # Run the IPYNB with the google colab extension i installed for vs code.
